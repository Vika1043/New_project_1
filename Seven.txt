It's the way that we can ride
It's the way that we can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Think I met you in another life
So break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You wrap around me and you give me life
And that's why night after night
I'll be lovin' you right
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday (a week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Seven days a week
Every hour, every minute, every second
You know night after night
I'll be lovin' you right, seven days a week
